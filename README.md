The website is built on react-js library of javascript and that's why we need nodejs and npm installed
While installing nodejs and npm, try to install the latest versions. My node version is v18.17.0 and npm version is 9.6.7 
(You can refer to these links - https://nodejs.org/en/download
https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
)
To see if you already have Node.js and npm installed and check the installed version, run the following commands:
node -v
npm -v

In case you want to help developing it or simply saving it, you can fork the repository just by clicking the button on the top-right corner of this page
After the successful installation of nodejs and npm, clone the repository into your local system using below command: 
 git clone https://github.com/sarthak-kumar-shailendra/dropbox-ui.git

 To download required dependencies to your system, navigate to the directory where the cloned repository resides and execute following command:
 yarn install or  npm install
 
 Now the project is ready to use

 You can check it using yarn start or  npm start 
 It will open the website locally on your browser.
